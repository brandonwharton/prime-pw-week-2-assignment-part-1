    <p>When working with switches, should you always include a default, even
       if all possible cases are accounted for?</p>
    <p>Is there a "proper" way of leaving comments/ writing code to make it the
       most readable? I'm trying not to go too far past the line break in Atom,
       but doing so sometimes makes comments short and require multiple lines.
       Example: in my "second way" switch inside aboutMe.js, I have two separate
       comments that both require two lines to comment. I chose to make a second
       comment line and have it start in the same place. Since I have to break
       up my code block with a comment there, would I be better off starting a
       new line comment anyway and keeping it to one line? What are the best
       practices for keeping code as consise, readable, and consistent as possible?
       When should we choose a /* versus a few consecutive lines of // ? This may
       be a good thing to talk about in our one-on-one.</p>

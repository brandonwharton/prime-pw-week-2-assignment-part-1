// REQUIRED FEATURES:
// 1 - Create a variable called `firstName` and assign it the value of your first name
const firstName = 'Brandon';
// 2 - Create a second variable called `lastName` and assign it the value of your last name
const lastName = 'Wharton';
// 3 - Create a third variable called `fullName`, assign it the value of your first and last name
// (remember, you already have variables for this, can you use those?)
const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
// 4 - Console log the value of `fullName`
console.log( fullName );
// 5 - Create a variable called `luckyNumber` and assign it the value of your lucky number.
let luckyNumber = 4;
// 6 - Console log this sentence, adding in the variables you created above:
// 'My name is (full name), and I think (lucky number) is a winner!'.
// Refer back to the videos if you need help with this one.
console.log( 'My name is', fullName + ', and I think', luckyNumber, 'is a winner!' );
// Or this could be done:
console.log( `My name is ${fullName}, and I think ${luckyNumber} is a winner!` );

// 7 - Create a variable named `adventurous` and set it to a boolean value (true or false)
let adventurous = true;
// 8 - Create a variable named `food`, and set its value to a string of your favorite food
let food = 'Red Curry';
// 9 - Create a variable called `pets` and set it to the value of the number of pets you have
let pets = 2;
// 10 - Create a variable called `friendsPets` and assign it the value of the number of pets your friend has
let friendsPets = 0;
// 11 - Add two pets to your `pets` variable
pets += 2;
// 12 - Create a constant variable called `allowedPets` and set it to a number value of your choice
let allowedPets = 5;
// 13 - Create a conditional: if adventurous is true, console log "Adventures are great!",
// if it's not true, console log "How about we stay home?"
if ( adventurous ){
  console.log( 'Adventures are great!' );
} // Logs if adventurous is true.
else {
  console.log( 'How about we stay home?' );
} // Logs if adventurous is false.

// 14 - Create a compound conditional: if luckyNumber is 2 and adventurous is true,
// console log "Roll the dice!"
if ( luckyNumber === 2 && adventurous ) {
  console.log( 'Roll the dice!' );
} // For our luckyNumber of 4, nothing is logged. If we change luckyNumber to 2,
  //and since adventurous is "true" above, it would then log "Roll the dice!".

// 15 - Write a conditional that console logs "I can have more pets!"
//if the value of `pets` is less than the value of `allowedPets`,
// console logs "I have enough pets" if the value of `pets` is equal to the value of `allowedPets`,
// and console logs "Oh no, I have too many pets!"
// if the value of `pets` is greater than the value of `allowedPets`.
if ( pets < allowedPets ){
  console.log( 'I can have more pets!' );
} // Logs if pets is less than allowedPets.
else if ( pets === allowedPets ) {
  console.log( 'I have enough pets' );
} // Logs if the variables are the same.
else {
  console.log( 'Oh no, I have too many pets!' );
} // Logs in any other cases, this one being if pets exceeds allowedPets.

// STRETCH GOALS:

// 16 - Make a variable called `mostPets` and a conditional that
// correctly checks the `pets` and `friendsPets` variables, and
// assigns the highest value to `mostPets`. There's several possibilities --
// be sure to think through all the scenarios.
// console.log `mostPets` after the conditional has run.

let mostPets;

if ( pets <= friendsPets ) {
  mostPets = friendsPets;
} // Assigns mostPets to friendsPets, since if friendsPets is greater that's the
  // value we want, and if they're the same we could assign mostPets to either.
else {
  mostPets = pets;
} // Properly assigning mostPets if pets is the greater number.
console.log( mostPets );

// 17 - Rewrite question 16 with a `switch` statement. You'll need to do research!

//One way
switch ( true ) {  // In this example, I'm using the switch to determine if
                   // the conditions in each case come out as true.
  case ( pets < friendsPets ):
    mostPets = friendsPets;
    break;
  case ( pets === friendsPets ):
    mostPets = friendsPets; // I could have set mostPets to pets here instead.
    break;
  case ( pets > friendsPets ):
    mostPets = pets;
    break;
  default: // Not sure if a default was necessary here.
    console.log( 'Get some pets first.' );
    break;
}
console.log( 'Switch 1', mostPets );

//Second way
switch ( pets <= friendsPets ) { // This one is nearly identical to my if else
                                 // from question 16, simply checking two cases.
  case true:
    mostPets = friendsPets;
    break;
  case false:
    mostPets = pets;
    break;
  default: // Same story: not sure if I needed to make a default for a switch like
           // this with only two possible outcomes.
    console.log( 'Get some pets first.' );
    break;
}
console.log( 'Switch 2', mostPets );

// 18 -- Rewrite question 13 with a `ternary` operator. You'll need to do research!
adventurous ? console.log( 'Adventures are great!' )
: console.log( 'How about we stay home?' );
